# Class Grade Calculator

## Overview
This Java program calculates the average grade of a student based on input for five different subjects: Mathematics, Physics, Turkish, Chemistry, and Music. If any of the input grades are outside the valid range of 0 to 100, an error message is displayed, and the program terminates. The final average is then used to determine if the student has passed or failed the class.

## Usage
1. **Clone the repository:**
   - `git clone https://github.com/your-username/class-grade-calculator.git`

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   - `cd class-grade-calculator`

3. **Compile and run the Java program:**
   - `javac Main.java`
   - `java Main`

4. **Enter the grades for each subject when prompted:**
   - Mathematics: [your_math_grade]
   - Physics: [your_physics_grade]
   - Turkish: [your_turkish_grade]
   - Chemistry: [your_chemistry_grade]
   - Music: [your_music_grade]

## Example

Enter your Mathematics grade: 80
Enter your Physics grade: 75
